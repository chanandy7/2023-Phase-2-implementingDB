<h3>Creating POCO classes</h2>
  <i>POCOs (Plain Old CLR Object) are simply C# classes that represent data structures/</i>
  <p>
    Create a new folder called Models. This folder will represent all the POCOs. 
    
    TodoItem.cs will represent one Todo item/Task
    TodoList.cs will represent a collection of items/tasks
    Notice these classes are just plain C# classes.

<h3>Connecting it to a DB</h3>
The connection strings to the database are stored in appsettings.json

<h4>Using an inmemory database</h4>
  For testing using an in-memory database can be used. An example of this can be seen in the main branch in Program.cs
  Remember to install the Nuget packages: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`
  
<h4>Using SQL Database with Docker</h4>
  For an example on how to connect to an SQL database have a look in the feature/mysql branch in Program.cs. 
  Notice it is very similar to using an in-memory database. 
  Remember to install the Nuget packages: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
